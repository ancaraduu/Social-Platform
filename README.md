## Social Platform OOP Java Class Assignement
The purpose of this assignment is the development of a simplified socialization platform to simulate user interactions through classes and objects. This assignment has helped me understand and apply the already learned concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), such as encapsulation, interfaces, and abstraction.

This assignment follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology, where the "expectations" from the software are provided, and the created application must "align" its development accordingly.4
